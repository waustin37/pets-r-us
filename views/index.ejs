                <h3 id="about-statement" style="font-weight: 200;">
                    Pets-R-Us is a family owned and operated, one-stop-shop, for all your pet needs. 
                    We opened our doors in 1976 as a small pet store focused on natural pet-foods. Since then, 
                    we have expanded out business to grooming and training, as well as a luxury doggie-day-care with overnight
                    cage-free boarding. 
                    Through all this we have not forgotten our roots. We still only sell the highest quality, natural pet foods 
                    and supplies. 
                    So whether you are looking for a new leash, a resupply on your favorite pet foods, or a safe place to leave 
                    your furry friend, Pets-R-Us is the place for you.
